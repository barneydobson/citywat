## Getting Started
These instructions will help you install a copy of CityWat and run our example case for London.

### Requirements
CityWat has been developed using Python 3.7.4. 
This is most easily installed with Anaconda by following instructions at: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/.

The following Python modules are required: 
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - tqdm
 - matplotlib
 
If using Anaconda these can be installed by adding the channel 'conda-forge' (see https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/manage-channels/ for adding channels), then adding each module (see https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/install-packages/).

CityWat has been tested using Python 2.7.15. ``from __future__ import division`` will need to be added to the top of each script if using Python 2.7.X.

### Install
Download or clone this repository.

### Try an example application
- Open Python using your IDE of choice, starting 'Spyder' from Anaconda is recommended for those new to Python.
- Navigate to and open 'example.py', found in the 'scripts' folder of this repository.
- Run the script by pressing F5.
